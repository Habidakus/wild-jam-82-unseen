class_name StateMachine extends Node
## The manager class for a control node state machine.
##
## All states (implementing [StateMachineState]) for this state machine should live as immediate
## children of the [StateMachine] node in the tree.
##
## An example of this code being used can be found at https://github.com/Habidakus/min-max-godot-addon
## where this addon is also located.

## Indicates which [StateMachineState] instance should be the start state when the state machine starts up, 
@export var initial_state : StateMachineState = null

## A list of all registered states
var all_states : Array = []
## Which state is currently running
var current_state : StateMachineState = null
