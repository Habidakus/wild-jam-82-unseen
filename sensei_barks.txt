<intro>
You have come to me to master ninja fishing.
I am California Sensei.
Attend me, my dude.
Walk to my pond just to the east.
Return when you have caught two fish.

<two fish complete>
The real journey now begins. 
Head north to Three Ponds area.
Catch five fish and return.

<after first smokebomb use>
Your skills will always let you evade the Oni.
You slip away like a tech CEO evading taxes.
But any hit of smoke ruins the nuances of flavor found in ninja fish.
These fish are ruined, my dude.

<after smokebomb use (on any map) say random line from list>
- Be as silent as a Friday night in Modesto.
- Be as still at the Pacific at low tide.
- Before casting, listen closely to your inner child.
- Perhaps, bait the hook with some avocado? However, I am out of both avocado and toast.
- The oni are stoked about your failure.
<then say>
These fish are ruined, my dude. Try again!

<after catching 5 fish in three ponds>
It is now time to fish horseshoe lake.
It is hella difficult. Head south.
Bring me five dank fish unruined by smoke and you will have mastered ninja fishing.

<after catching 5 fish in horsehoe lake>
You have mastered ninja fishing.
Rad.
