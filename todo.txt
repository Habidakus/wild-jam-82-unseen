Things I think we need before we can call it beta:
- D - sensei (sprite, code, dialog & dialog progression logic)
- A - report cards from sensei (categories: summary of fish caught, stealthy grade, hint for any challenges encountered but failed)
- D - report cards from sensei - this will need art for the text to appear on
- A - hook up a settings page
- D - at least two more mini-games
- A - player should stop fishing and bark to return to the sensei when they have five fishes
- A - Farthest Oni from you should start tracking you when you complete a fishing game successfully
- D - credit screen (something we can click on in game) - will need in map art, background for text art
- D - unlocking fishing areas (report cards unlock progressively harder maps)
- A - hook up smoke bomb (art and sound)

Stretch goals:
- add your third map with more fish and more mini-games
- add high score tracker (sensei will first need to ask you your name)
- stop allowing casting on the ground, or at least stop the floater from bobbing when on the grass
