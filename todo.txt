Things I think we need before we can call it beta:
- sensei (sprite, code, dialog & dialog progression logic)
- report cards from sensei (categories: summary of fish caught, stealthy grade, hint for any challenges encountered but failed), this will need art for the text to appear on?
- hook up a settings page
- at least two more mini-games
- simplify walking & sneaking into one movement (and possibly we don't do meditation, but you need to be sneaking to make sure that some fish games don't vanish on you)
- fix the running sound
- player should stop fishing and bark to return to the sensei when they have five fishes
- Oni should emit a sound when they hear you and start tracking you
- Farthest Oni from you should start tracking you when you complete a fishing game successfully
- credit screen (something we can click on in game) - will need in map art, background for text art
- unlocking fishing areas (report cards unlock progressively harder maps)
- swap the direction of the fishing pole if casting to the left
- hook up smoke bomb (art and sound)
- extend map so that it doesn't look that janky when the player reaches the edge and there's just grey

Stretch goals:
- add your third map with more fish and more mini-games
- add high score tracker (sensei will first need to ask you your name)
- stop allowing casting on the ground, or at least stop the floater from bobbing when on the grass
