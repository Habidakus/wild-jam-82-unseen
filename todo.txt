Things I think we need before we can call it beta:
- A - sensei (code)
- A - report cards from sensei (categories: summary of fish caught, stealthy grade, hint for any challenges encountered but failed)
- A - hook up a settings page
- A - player should stop fishing and bark to return to the sensei when they have five fishes
- A - Farthest Oni from you should start tracking you when you complete a fishing game successfully
- A - hook up fences that vanish once a player is allowed into a particular map

Stretch goals:
- add your third map with more fish and more mini-games
- add high score tracker (sensei will first need to ask you your name)
- stop allowing casting on the ground, or at least stop the floater from bobbing when on the grass
- when mouse clicking on land, it's a thrown rock to distract Oni
