Things I think we need before we can call it beta:
- A - hook up a settings page
- A - Farthest Oni from you should start tracking you when you complete a fishing game successfully
- A - times_seen in the report card should be seconds_seen
- We should tell the players that they've officially won the game
- A - better dialog line when the player brings five fish, but they are from different ponds

Stretch goals:
- add your third map with more fish and more mini-games
- add high score tracker (sensei will first need to ask you your name)
- stop allowing casting on the ground, or at least stop the floater from bobbing when on the grass
- when mouse clicking on land, it's a thrown rock to distract Oni
